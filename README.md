## Overview

Time Banking Protocol revolutionizes how people exchange skills and services by:
- Creating a trustless system for skill verification
- Enabling secure time-based value exchange
- Automating expertise validation and time tracking
- Building a decentralized marketplace for skill trading

## Key Features

### Skill Verification System
- Decentralized skill registration
- Expert-based verification process
- Immutable skill attestations

### Time Banking Mechanism
- Secure time unit tracking
- Smart contract-based exchange
- Automated balance management

### Trust and Reputation
- Blockchain-based reputation system
- Verifiable completion records
- Time-value adjustments based on expertise

## Technical Stack

- **Blockchain**: Stacks
- **Smart Contracts**: Clarity
- **Frontend** (Coming Soon): React.js
- **Testing**: Clarinet

## Smart Contract Architecture

The protocol consists of several key components:
1. Skill Registration and Verification
2. Time Commitment Management
3. Exchange Completion Verification
4. Balance Tracking System

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Stacks wallet (Hiro or similar)
- Clarinet for local development
- Node.js and npm (for upcoming frontend)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/gboigwe/time-banking-protocol.git
cd time-banking-protocol
```

2. Install Clarinet (if not already installed)
```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://install.clarinet.sh | sh
```

3. Initialize the project
```bash
clarinet integrate
```

### Development Setup

1. Start local Clarinet chain
```bash
clarinet chain
```

2. Deploy contracts (local development)
```bash
clarinet deploy
```

## Smart Contract Functions

### Public Functions

- `register-skill`: Register a new skill for verification
- `verify-skill`: Verify a user's skill (verifier only)
- `commit-time`: Commit time units for a specific skill exchange
- `complete-time-exchange`: Mark a time exchange as completed

### Read-Only Functions

- `get-skill-verification`: Check if a skill is verified
- `get-time-balance`: Get a user's time unit balance

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
clarinet test
```

## Contribution Guidelines

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch
3. Commit your changes
4. Push to the branch
5. Create a Pull Request

## Security

- All smart contracts are designed with security-first principles
- Time commitments are immutably recorded on the Stacks blockchain
- Skill verifications require multi-party attestation

## Roadmap

- [ ] Core smart contract development
- [ ] Frontend interface development
- [ ] Skill marketplace implementation
- [ ] Mobile application development
- [ ] Cross-chain integration capabilities
